# Lecture 1: Probability Concepts (Part 1)

## Random Variables and Distributions

- Overview of random variables
- Discrete vs Continuous random variables
- Important distributions (Binomial, Normal, Chi-Square)

```{{r}}
# Simulating random variables
N <- 100; mu <- 5; sig <- 2
Y <- rnorm(N, mean = mu, sd = sig)
hist(Y, main="Histogram of Normal Distribution", xlab="Y values", col="lightblue")
```

## Example: Central Limit Theorem

- Discuss the CLT and its importance in statistics
- Simulating the CLT with normal distributions

```{{r}}
# Central Limit Theorem simulation
means <- replicate(1000, mean(rnorm(100, mean = mu, sd = sig)))
hist(means, main="Central Limit Theorem", col="lightgreen", border="black")
```

# Lecture 2: Discrete and Continuous Distributions (Part 2)

## Common Distributions in Statistical Computing

- Binomial Distribution
- Poisson Distribution
- Normal Distribution and its properties

```{{r}}
# Simulating binomial and Poisson distributions
x_binom <- rbinom(100, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
x_pois <- rpois(100, lambda = 3)

par(mfrow=c(1, 2))  # Two plots side by side
hist(x_binom, main="Binomial Distribution", col="orange")
hist(x_pois, main="Poisson Distribution", col="lightcoral")
```

## Joint and Conditional Distributions

- Joint distributions and their importance
- Conditional distributions with examples

```{{r}}
# Simulating joint distributions
mu <- c(5, 10); sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 2), 2, 2)
library(MASS)
X <- mvrnorm(1000, mu = mu, Sigma = sigma)

plot(X[,1], X[,2], main="Scatter plot of Joint Distribution", xlab="X1", ylab="X2", col="blue")
```

# Lecture 3: Statistics Review (Part 3)

## Estimators and Their Properties

- Discuss point estimators: Mean, Variance, etc.
- Review bias, consistency, and efficiency

```{{r}}
# Example of calculating mean and variance from samples
set.seed(123)
sample_data <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)
mean(sample_data)
var(sample_data)
```

## Hypothesis Testing

- Hypothesis testing steps
- Type I and II errors, significance level, and power

```{{r}}
# Example of hypothesis testing
t_test_result <- t.test(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2), mu=5)
t_test_result
```

## Confidence Intervals

- Constructing confidence intervals for population mean
- Example with real data

```{{r}}
# Example: Confidence interval for normal data
conf_interval <- t.test(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2))$conf.int
conf_interval
```

# Conclusion

- Recap of probability concepts, distributions, and hypothesis testing
- Review key formulas and concepts for exam preparation
