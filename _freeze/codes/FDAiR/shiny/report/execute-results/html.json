The following inputs will be used in sub-panels **Basis Functions** (to generate the basis functions), **FDA** and **FPCA** (run and report the `FPCA` algorithm):\n\n* [Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial) of B-spline Basis:  \n* [Deg. of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom) of B-spline Basis:  \n* Two Dimension:\n* \\# of Common bivatiate Basis (\\# of Clusters for Clustering):\n* 3D Visualition: \n    + [Contour Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) in [R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/filled.contour.html)\n    + [Heat Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) in [R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/contour.html)\n    + [Perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_graph) in [R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/persp.html)\n        + [Azimuthal Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system)\n        + [Polar Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system)\n\n\nThe first two inputs are mostly to describe the *basis functions*. The fourth input is to specify the number common basis in *FPCA* algorithm, and number of clusters to produce the outputs. The fifth input specify the type of plots produced in sub-panels **Basis Functions**, **FDA** and **FPCA** (for 2D cases).\n\n# Main Panel\n## Data\nOne can either use the files posted in Server\n\n* TS-m=xx-n=yyy\n\nor upload a different file to be analyzed.\n\nor simulate functions.\n\n## Basis Functions\n* Using some visualization techniques, we illustrate the B-spline basis that is used in the algorithm.\n\n## Data Description (FDA Summary)\nThe [Scree plot](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/screeplot.html) is the last output of *Data Description (FDA Summary)* panel. It can be used as a visualizing tool to obtain the required number of `common basis` based on the initial estimate (obtained by [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix) the observed functions(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodogram) to the [column space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_spaces#Column_space) of the [basis expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function)).  \n\n* The remaining _Data Description_ choices are used to summarize and visualize the _FDA_ input data:\n\n## FPCA\n* The _FPCA_ algorithm is implemented in this sub-panel\n* Also the results and graphs is provided here.\n\n## Manual\nThe sub-panel that contains this _instruction manual_.\n",
